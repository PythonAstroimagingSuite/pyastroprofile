Profiles
--------

Profiles are configobj objects modified to have attributes which you can get
and set.

Depending on the operating system the config files will be stored under a
top level base directory.

When a profile object is created the relative directory under the base OS config
directory is specified as well as a name for the profile file.  Usually these
have a '.ini' extension but this is not requrired.

If no relative directory is given then the default is 'astroprofiles'.

If no filename or a filename of 'default' (case sensitive!) is provideed
then a default profile will be searched for by looking for a file called
DEFAULT_PROFILE with the contents:

    default=<profilename>

which specifies the filename of the default profile.

The default for a given profile directory can be set with the
set_default_profile() function, and can be retrieved with the
get_default_profile() function.

A list of the profiles available can be retrieved with find_profiles().

Observatory Profile
-------------------
This profile stores the info for an observing location.  Internally it is
stored as lat/lon/alt/name/tz, but usually one will get or set the
'observer' attribute which is an astroplan observer object.

Equipment Profile
-----------------
This profile just stores strings for the driver names for the camera, mount,
focuser and filterwheel in use.  Different profiles can be used for each
imaging setup, for example.  Also using the default profile mechanism one
can set the default equipment profile and all the programs needing to
use equipment can get it without having to specify it to each on the command line.
